# Pomodoro Chrome Extension - Version 1.0
A chrome extension based on the Pomodoro Technique, a time-management method with time specified intervals of work with breaks inbetween.

#### Bugs:
> - ~1s timer delay on button actions

#### TODO:

 > **Priority:**
 > (1) Custom breaks/ work durations via settings on main page or some other method
 > (1) main.html GUI - currently copied from popup.js. Will be modified to be made more unique


#### If Time Permits:

> **Priority:**
> (1) Custom music playing
> (1) Stretch recommendations
> (2) Website redirecting  
> (3) Statistics enabling
